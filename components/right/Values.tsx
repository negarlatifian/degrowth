      <Subtitle>Well-being</Subtitle>
      <Text>
        Well-being in the literature of degrowth is understood as the fulfilment
        of fundamental human needs, encompassing not only material comfort but
        also social relationships, autonomy, ecological sustainability, and a
        sense of purpose. It involves a balanced and equitable distribution of
        resources, fostering resilient communities, and a lifestyle that
        respects the ecological limits of the planet. This contradicts the most
        common metrics of “well-being” within capitalist society, such as
        material wealth.

      <Subtitle>Care</Subtitle>
      <Text>
        Care is fundamental work for the welfare of people and communities.
        Generally speaking, it’s all the daily actions devoted to sustenance,
        reproduction and the contentment of human relations. This already
        touches all facets of human life, but to focus within the art world,
        this includes all of the unseen work that goes into making sure
        everything runs smoothly: that the space is cleaned, coffee and wine are
        available, admin is taken care of, fellow collaborators don’t kill each
        other.

      <Text>
        Understanding and valuing care requires a recognition of our inherent
        interdependency – no one is self-made, and we all must rely on one
        another in order to survive and thrive.5 In our current neoliberal and
        patriarchal paradigm care work is systematically devalued and obscured,
        with those of us responsible for most of the care-giving being also
        those most excluded: such as women, migrants, and the working class.
        Ideas of social welfare have been pushed aside for individualised
        notions of resilience, wellness and self-improvement. By acknowledging
        and centering care in our lives, practices, and societies, we are also
        centering well-being and equity. When we think of ourselves as lone
        individuals and act as such, keeping ourselves isolated from each other,
        we further entrench ourselves and those around us in precarity. The
        alternative is to instead work in solidarity with each other.{' '}

      <Subtitle>Community / Collectivity</Subtitle>
      <Text>
        Community is understood here as a collective and interconnected social
        entity characterised by shared values, mutual support, and a commitment
        to a shared goal. It’s important here to not fall into the trap of an
        idealised depiction of community as a place of unconditional love and
        support (such a thing does not exist), or as a vague catch-all term
        denoting a group of people who presumably have the same experiences or
        interests (that is, of course, presumptuous). Communities are
        fundamentally pragmatic networks of autonomous members based upon
        reciprocal relationships that must function, and require continued care
        work in order to maintain their health and functionality.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The emphasis on community and collectivity here works in tandem with the
        point made in the section on care: pushing back against the idea of the
        individual as an isolated being.{' '}
      </Text>
      <Text>
        On a practical level, coming together and pooling resources creates a
        synergy effect – leading to a more intensive and diverse use of
        resources, and therefore to a strengthening of a solidarity-based
        culture of contributions. This, in turn, can promote mutual inspiration
        and local support. And, of course, in terms of bringing about change in
        the art world: the reality is that no systemic change can be achieved by
        lone individuals, and when we work alone we are much easier to push
        around.
