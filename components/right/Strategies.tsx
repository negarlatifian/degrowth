      <Subtitle>Slowness / Laziness</Subtitle>
      <Text>
        Slowness and laziness come here as the direct opposites of and antidotes
        to efficiency and overwork. Embracing a certain degree of laziness
        challenges the relentless pursuit of constant activity and output. It
        encourages us to resist the narrative that busyness equates success and
        to prioritise moments of rest and reflection. In these moments of
        apparent inactivity, ideas compost beneath the surface, and a more
        deliberate approach to artistic production can emerge. Intentionally
        pivoting towards slowness and laziness within our artistic practices
        represents a radical departure from the prevailing obsession with
        productivity and a move towards well-being.

      <Subtitle>Making care work visible</Subtitle>
      <Text>
        The vast majority of the labour that goes into artistic projects is
        entirely unseen and peripheral to what we consider art-making proper. As
        mentioned in care, it is the endless maintenance work of making things
        run smoothly: the labour of facilitators, fabricators, organisers,
        supporters, and even educators, which usually goes uncredited and
        underpaid (if paid at all).{' '}
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Within a system that shines the spotlight only on the so-called “author”
        of a work, making this behind-the-scenes work visible undermines the
        myth of strictly individual achievement and paints a much more accurate
        picture of people’s contributions to a creative process. This is
        important for more than simple honesty – as this care labour is
        primarily done by marginalised art workers, naming and honouring their
        contributions enables us to break them out of the “background” and allow
        them to be appreciated for their own merits. It also sets the
        foundations to demand proper remuneration for care work on an
        institutional level.

      <Subtitle>Sharing resources</Subtitle>
      <Text>
        In a field where access to resources often determines visibility and
        success, sharing becomes a means of democratising opportunities. It
        breaks down barriers to entry within the art world for those who might
        be marginalised or excluded, allowing a diverse range of voices and
        perspectives to emerge. The act of sharing extends beyond mere material
        resources; it encompasses mentorship, support, and the creation of
        communal spaces where artists can work collectively.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        By sharing tools, spaces, and knowledge, we can create a network of
        support that transcends the boundaries of individuals and individual
        projects. This collaborative spirit not only enriches our artistic
        endeavours but also fosters a sense of solidarity among art workers. The
        exchange of resources becomes a form of mutual aid, strengthening the
        artistic community's resilience against challenges and fostering a
        culture of reciprocity.
      </Text>
      <Subtitle>
        Creating alternative and independent spaces and platforms
      </Subtitle>
      <Text>
        Alternative and independent spaces are fundamental for the existence of
        a vibrant artistic discourse. They offer a refuge for experimentation,
        enabling artists to explore themes and forms that might be deemed too
        radical or unconventional by established venues. They also allow younger
        artists to find their footing in the local scene, and give all local
        artists opportunities to meet and work together, contributing to
        community-building. Independent and alternative spaces become hubs for
        collaboration, dialogue, and the exchange of ideas, fostering a sense of
        belonging among artists who may feel marginalised or underrepresented in
        mainstream settings. In this way, alternative spaces play a crucial role
        in dismantling hierarchies and thus challenge the status quo. They
        become vital agents in the decentralisation of cultural authority,
        creating a more democratic and accessible avenue for artists to share
        their work with the public.{' '}
      </Text>
      <Subtitle>Self-organisation</Subtitle>
      <Text>
        At its core, self-organisation champions the idea that individuals,
        whether working independently or collectively, possess the capacity to
        imagine, define, and act independently and consciously. This autonomy
        extends to freedom from dependencies on external authorities, allowing
        artists to take full ownership of their own artistic practices.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Furthermore, self-organisation embodies a paradigm shift away from
        hierarchical structures, placing emphasis on collaboration, autonomy,
        and shared decision-making. One of the key strengths of
        self-organisation lies in its adaptability and responsiveness to the
        needs of artists and their communities. By avoiding rigid bureaucratic
        structures, self-organised initiatives can swiftly address emerging
        challenges, experiment with innovative approaches, and remain resilient
        in the face of external pressures.

        Redirection of institutional resources (or: being sneaky)
      </Subtitle>
      <Text>
        The vast majority of us have no option but to engage in the
        institutional game: we apply for grants, we work with galleries, we hunt
        commissions. Sometimes, we even manage to be successful in these
        endeavours. And, the more successful we are, the more opportunities
        continue to come our way. And, if we’re quite lucky, now and then we’ll
        find ourselves into (perhaps temporary, perhaps not-so-temporary)
        positions of privilege – controlling a variety of resources. By bending
        the rules when we can and redirecting or redistributing some of those
        resources when we can, we can actively engage in the dismantling of
        systemic inequalities, contributing to a more just and inclusive
        cultural landscape.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        As we know, in most institutional settings resources have been
        historically concentrated among a select few, perpetuating exclusivity
        and limiting opportunities for a more diverse array of artists. The act
        of redirecting resources seeks to break down these barriers by
        prioritising inclusivity, amplifying marginalised voices, and fostering
        a more democratic distribution of support.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This redirection can take various forms, including offering financial
        help, exhibition opportunities, and educational resources. Financial
        resources are channelled towards projects that align with values of
        diversity, equity, and inclusion, ensuring that artists from
        underrepresented backgrounds receive the support needed to thrive.
        Exhibition opportunities can be shared with others, bringing forward a
        broader spectrum of voices, challenging the dominance of certain
        narratives and perspectives.

      <Subtitle>Militant optimism – or, utopianism as strategy</Subtitle>
      <Quote>
        Distinct from mere naïve optimism, which is blind to power and awaits
        with hope some kind of automatic transformation, militant optimism
        identifies hidden possibilities and acts like a kind of amplifier,
        making [possible, concrete utopias] visible, engaging them actively, and
        weaving them into new configurations. Concrete utopias also have a
        prefigurative and performative power: they open up space for imagining
        alternatives and in doing so they act against the effectiveness of
        TINA-narratives (TINA: there is no alternative).9
      </Quote>
      <Text>
        Militant optimism implies a proactive, determined approach to
        cultivating hope proposing counter-hegemonic narratives. It rejects
        passive acceptance of the status quo and embraces the belief that,
        through collective effort and creative action, a better future is not
        only possible but achievable. This optimism operates as a driving force,
        motivating people to engage with the world in transformative ways.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This complements the notion of utopia, framed as not “something
        unfeasible and unattainable, but instead as a description of a desired
        world to come", that "fosters a likelihood of change, and points to an
        unfulfilled future that differs from the present". Thus, it contains
        both a description and a process. Utopianism, like utopia, contains a
        description and a process, but puts a particular emphasis on the
        latter.10
      </Text>
      <Text>
        For many, talk of “optimism” and “utopia” sounds hopelessly idealistic
        and naive, if not outright cringeworthy. But, why should we surrender
        imagination? To whom are we supposed to relinquish the possibilities of
        our future? Defeatism is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If not even artists
        cannot allow themselves to be idealistic, then who can?
      </Text>
      <Subtitle>
        Navigating contradictions – or, staying with the trouble
      </Subtitle>
      <Text>
        The freedom to live and act according to the values one holds is, in
        some ways, a privilege. Most of us have to compromise our ideals to
        navigate the practicalities of everyday life within existing systems. We
        talk about the radical potential of rest and non-participation in the
        neoliberal system; and then we have to work on multiple crappy projects
        at once, just to make rent. We work with and for institutions we
        consider exploitative. We compete tooth and nail for grants,
        residencies, commissions.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        These incongruities can crush any optimistic feeling and make it seem
        like all attempts at systemic change are pointless. The word “hypocrisy”
        might come to mind. But then – how possible is it to change a system
        from the “outside”? Is there even an “outside” that is entirely
        independent from the “inside”? Is there only one way to bring about
        change? Is there only one way to be “radical”?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The idea of “staying with the trouble” embraces the messiness inherent
        in these endeavours. To stay with the trouble means to acknowledge the
        discomfort of contradictions and to confront challenges and inevitable
        failures without abandoning the pursuit of transformative change. We
        must stay with it long enough to adjust, adapt, and try again. The
        change we’re looking for is the result of a process of continuously
        proposing, testing, critiquing, and proposing anew; of growing, pushing,
        cracking, splitting, growing once more.
