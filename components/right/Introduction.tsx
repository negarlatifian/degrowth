        The Degrowth Toolbox for Artistic Practices is both a proposal and an
        invitation. Emerging from an ongoing artistic research process, The
        Toolbox asks:

      <Quote>
        How can a degrowth approach to the arts be imagined and implemented? Art
        is often mobilised within activist movements in the service of social
        change, but how can activist values enter artistic practices to create a
        more equitable and humane field?

        The purpose is to formulate a conceptual framework for creative and
        exhibitionary practices aimed towards degrowth, while simultaneously
        composing a toolbox for artists, curators, as well as institutions,
        aimed towards designing ethical and sustainable creative practices
        during this period of prolonged social crisis and beyond.

        The material here begins with a brief overview of the concept of
        degrowth, to then move on to some key values and disavowals. Based on
        these, The Toolbox puts forward a set of strategies directed towards
        creating greater equity in the arts.

        The Degrowth Toolbox for Artistic Practices offers some starting
        thoughts, some positions and provocations â€“ but the material presented
        here is offered as a proposal, as a starting point for further dialogue,
        as something to build upon and to dismantle. It is not presented as
        authoritative nor resolved.
