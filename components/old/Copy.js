            The purpose of this project is to formulate a conceptual framework
            for creative and exhibitionary practices aimed towards degrowth:
            composing a toolbox for art workers and organisations interested in
            designing ethical and sustainable creative practices during the
            pandemic and beyond.

            Degrowth is the idea that we need to construct our societies around
            the values of well-being, conviviality, autonomy, sustainability,
            inclusion, and care. These values come hand-in-hand with the
            rejection of the capitalist, authoritarian, patriarchal and colonial
            paradigms. The focus here is placed on formulating tools and
            strategies which are applicable in the arts.

            <i>Degrowth</i> (or <i>décroissance</i> in French) was used for the
            first time by philosopher André Gorz in 1972. Gorz posed a question
            that remains at the centre of degrowth discourse: “Is the earth’s
            balance, for which no-growth – or even degrowth – of material
            production is a necessary condition, compatible with the survival of
            the capitalist system?” Décroissance flourished into an activist
            movement in Lyon in the early 2000s, and spreading from there, it
            became a slogan mobilized by green and anti-globalization activists
            in Italy in 2004 (as ‘decrescita’) and Catalonia and Spain in 2006
            (as ‘decreixement’ and ‘decrecimiento’). The English term ‘degrowth’
            was ‘officially’ used for the first time at a 2008 Paris conference,
            marking the birth of an international research community.

            Degrowth is a term that is often perceived as negative or even
            off-putting, as it is conflated with “recession” or “decline”. On
            the contrary, degrowth refers to a conscious, collective,
            <em>intentional</em> commitment to significantly reducing production
            and consumption, to finding alternatives to our current
            organisational models (be they economic or otherwise) and to
            proactively transform society.
          </>,
          <>
            The prefix <i>de-</i> signifies a complete rejection of the concept
            of
            <em>growth</em> and all the expectations that come with it –
            production for the sake of production and consumption for the sake
            of consumption. Degrowth questions the capitalist understanding of
            “more” as “better” and instead proposes that we need to construct
            our world around the values of well-being, conviviality, autonomy,
            inclusion, and care.
          </>,
          <>
            In these respects, degrowth is fundamentally an anticapitalist and
            decolonial endeavour, as it is diametrically opposed to
            capitalist-colonial ideas of infinite growth and expansion, of
            perpetual exploitation, while centering the voices and well-being of
            those currently in the margins of white Western capitalist
            cisheteropatriarchy, be they human or non-human. Degrowth does not
            call for doing less of the same. In a degrowth society everything
            will be different: different activities, different forms and uses of
            energy, different relations, different gender roles, different
            allocations of time between paid and non-paid work, different
            relations with the non-human world. The degrowth imaginary centres
            around the reproductive economy of care, and the reclaiming of old –
            and the creation of new – commons. Caring in common is embodied in
            new forms of living and producing, such as eco-communities and
            cooperatives.

            What the pandemic and subsequent crisis has made abundantly clear is
            that degrowth is necessary – that our current ways of working and
            organising are unsustainable and inadequate in adapting to the
            oncoming changes brought by not only by the pandemic itself, but by
            climate change, civil unrest, and by the broader paradigm shift. We
            art workers are faced with an opportunity to rethink and redesign
            our practices; degrowth presents a challenge to the status quo and
            offers a toolbox for transformative change.

            Artists have unique privileges in society: we have the power to
            claim space, resources, attention. We have the freedom – the
            expectation, even – to be questioning, idealistic, radical,
            innovative. We have the luxury to work independently, and explore
            any subject we personally find engaging. Finally, we are also
            uniquely trained in communication, and our particular position in
            society allows us to mediate between groups of people and to
            mobilise.
          </>,
          <>
            While these privileges make us, in theory, the perfect social
            agitators, instigators, innovators, the reality is that we are more
            often than not instrumentalised for the benefit of investors and
            bureaucrats. We are producers of luxury products, assistants in
            money laundering schemes for the absurdly rich; we are the
            emissaries of the state when it seeks to homogenize the cultural
            fabric of a city through public art institutions and cultural
            projects; we are the best friends of gentrifiers, disrupting the
            landscapes of neighbourhoods. Our presumed <em>wokeness</em> is used
            to whitewash all whom we associate with – a fresh coat of paint to
            hide a rotten core. This in itself is not a <em>radical</em> thing
            to say: we are all aware of these truths to some extent. Artists,
            despite our professed radicality, are in fact pillars of the
            institutions of capitalism, of colonialism, of classism.

            The world, however, is swiftly marching towards a future in which
            these institutions are defunct. As social inequality rises, as
            authoritarianism tightens its grip, as unmitigated and total climate
            catastrophe draws near, capitalism’s chokehold on humanity is
            becoming increasingly evident to all. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
            has massively contributed to exposing the inherent abuses in the
            infrastructure of Western/Northern society. Our world is changing
            rapidly: political ideas that were considered extreme just one year
            ago, have now become part of mainstream political discourse, such as
            universal basic income, debt cancellation, police abolition. This is
            a call for all artists and art workers to cease supporting the
            markets, to cease supporting the governments, to work towards
            hastening the old world’s demise: the world that puts capital above
            life.

            The core value of the endeavour delineated within this toolbox is
            the well-being of human and non-human life.

          <>
            From that starting point what immediately follows is the rejection
            of the capitalist market in general and the art market more
            specifically: the rejection of the directives of galleries,
            collectors, investors. Immediately following is the rejection of art
            bureaucracy; of all the institutions that ensure art remains
            obscure, elitist, <em>white</em>, that confine it within the safe
            walls of a white box or the decorative realm of a roundabout:
            academies, museums, kunsthalles, public art committees. What we need
            to do instead is invest in building strong relationships with each
            other, as an artistic community of creators, communicators,
            mediators – and invest in strengthening the other communities we are
            already part of, local or otherwise. Rejecting the “protection” of a
            gallery, university, or other institution, we must support each
            other professionally, mentally, emotionally. Should we choose to
            stay affiliated to an institution for whatever reason, it is
            imperative that we use our positions to redirect as many of its
            resources as possible to other communities, to other purposes. What
            is sorely needed is to build communities centered on care and
            solidarity.

            The above requires the complete rejection of the myth of the genius
            artist who creates masterpieces alone in <em>his</em> studio. This
            is a myth that refuses to die out despite the multitude of
            thinkpieces written on the subject, because the truth is that this
            image remains marketable – further yet, the entirety of the art
            world is built around it. Open calls for shows, residencies,
            stipends, and educational programs can only process us as
            individuals; galleries, museums, and magazines talk about superstar
            artists; we ourselves project the image of the brilliant artist
            whose creative vision is
            <em>his</em> and <em>his</em> alone (and anyone who might have
            helped with the project is merely a tool in the service of this
            vision). This is obviously a distortion of reality which serves to
            obscure the privilege and exploitation perpetrated by those at the
            top. Simultaneously, in acting as lone individuals, in keeping
            ourselves isolated from each other, we are left vulnerable to
            exploitation.
          </>,
          <>
            Another consequence of this environment is that it puts us in
            constant competition with one another. Artists, curators and other
            cultural workers are regularly called to compete with each other in
            open calls, which are usually the only avenue of work. This in and
            of itself precludes collaboration and even erodes pre-existing
            partnerships. The competitive model is in direct opposition with the
            work of community-building and must be rejected in its entirety.
          </>,
          <>
            A second consideration that arises from the starting premise is the
            rejection of the capitalist work ethic: the rejection of hustle
            culture; the rejection of the constant pressure to produce work, to
            be shown, to build your CV, to market, to be on brand, to constantly
            consider how any and every facet of your life can be somehow turned
            into an art product, to then in turn consume as much art and
            artistic literature as possible. This is not only ridiculous in
            itself, it is also damaging – to our physical and mental health, and
            to the environment as we furiously burn through resources. What is
            needed here is to pause; to unlearn this constant fretting over
            <em>productivity</em>; to acknowledge that we do not,{' '}
            <em>cannot</em> be productive or creative all the time. We must
            acknowledge the need for rest and the importance of recreation and
            play for our mental health. Decentering work in our lives makes
            space for recentering and investing time in social bonds, as
            mentioned above. The heightened anxiety over productivity which
            plagues the arts is, of course, due in large part to the particular
            financial precarity of our field. We must question how much our
            participation in the structures that keep us precarious perpetuates
            the existence of these structures; and we must, in any case, fight
            against worker exploitation in all fields.
          </>,
          <>
            Along that vein, we must look outside the confines of the art world
            and destroy all those barriers that keep art insular and obscure.
            Rejecting the patronage of white box institutions (as the
            inhospitable sterility of the white box has spread beyond gallery
            spaces and into academies, etc.), as mentioned above, is already a
            big step in this direction. What is needed however, particularly
            during this time of deepened inequality and social unrest, is to
            meaningfully consider: <i>what can I do for my community?</i> The
            running joke in our society is that art educations are useless, that
            we’re only good for so-called unskilled work (devaluing both art and
            essential workers in one fell swoop). In fact, the exact opposite is
            true: our unique privileges and skills as artists mentioned above
            grant us both the freedom to move between social groups and the
            tools with which to mediate between them. This is not to say that we
            should promote ourselves to ambassadors of our local activist
            organisations, of course. Rather, what is needed is a genuine
            engagement with our communities, and through dialogue and the
            fostering of mutual relationships, discovering what the needs of
            these communities are. Perhaps a neighbourhood is in need of a
            communal food garden: in which case, an artist might help secure a
            plot of land through legal or illegal means under the guise of a
            socially engaged art project. Perhaps a mutual aid group requires
            help in reaching more people: in which case an artist could design
            communication material. Or, perhaps, the residents of an apartment
            building simply want a decorative mural for the shared spaces:
            that’s fine too. The point here is to both democratise art and to
            formulate artistic projects with the needs of their intended public
            at the forefront.

            It would be remiss to talk about degrowth and to not bring up
            ecological considerations. As hinted at earlier, the art world is
            not miraculously spared from the endless loop of production and
            consumption which is the foundation of a capitalist economy. As we
            compete with each other for space, visibility, and resources, we are
            obliged to constantly produce <em>more</em> and <em>bigger</em>. The
            result of the pressure to stay active, to have a strong portfolio,
            to chase opportunities, is that we often work half-heartedly on
            projects and exhibitions which merely exist to be a line in a CV.
            Simultaneously, these projects are often inflated to be as
            spectacular, as flashy and as eye-catching as possible. Vast amounts
            of resources are poured Into this grapple for who gets to be the
            star of the show, and the result is often empty of meaning, left to
            languish in storage rooms. This, of course, is massively wasteful.
            In recentering care, solidarity, and real need in our practices, we
            can do away with this unnecessary, lavish peacocking.

            In all of the above, the importance of self-organisation cannot be
            stressed enough. If we are to create the conditions for a
            post-capitalist post-growth society, we must set the groundwork for
            independent grassroots organisations to flourish. In this endeavour,
            we must learn and practice the tools and strategies of
            collaboration; of consensus; of mutual aid; of horizontal
            organisation. As we work against all that which dehumanises us,
            destroys us, destroys the planet, we must remember that as lone
            individuals we can achieve next to nothing – it is only in
            collaboration, in each other that we may find a way out of our
            dystopic present.

            Finally, we must not be afraid to do away with the thinking that
            wants mutual care, well-being, and peaceful horizontal collaboration
            and collaboration to be idealistic; and that considers idealism to
            be a fool’s pursuit. Defeatism is a self-fulfilling prophecy. And,

            In relation to the above considerations, we might ask ourselves a
            series of questions to direct us in the making of our projects – as
            there cannot be, of course, a singular definitive approach to art
            making that is suitable for all practices and applicable in all
            contexts, nor can there always be a clear black-and-white definition
            of an ethical artistic practice.

            The first and most fundamental question for any project, artistic or
            otherwise, is:
            <br />
            <i>Who is this for?</i>
            <br />

            <i>Who benefits from this?</i> and,{' '}
            <i>Has anyone asked for this?</i> or,{' '}
            <i>Is this contributing to an ongoing discussion?</i> There is, of
            course, a multitude of possible answers to these questions and there
            isn’t one that is “more correct” than the others. The main objective
            here is to examine whether the intent behind a project and the
            actual reality of it coincide. At the same time, it is important to
            consider who we might be inadvertently supporting through our work,
            and to weigh the pros and cons of a situation: a socially engaged
            artistic project that is genuinely helping and redirecting resources
            to a community might also be indirectly serving to legitimise an art
            institution with less than ethical practices. Being strategic is the
            most important thing here.

            Alternatively, we might begin a project by asking ourselves:
            <br />
            <i>What is the change I want my work to bring to my community?</i>
            <br />
            From this starting point we are immediately in dialogue with the
            needs of other people and groups, as well as taking a critical
            position against the status quo. This also tends to prioritise the
            specific needs of a local community, of people we might personally
            know and have relationships with, rather than the demands of an
            international art market. From this point, we may also ask:
            <br />
            <i>How can my experience and expertise be constructive?</i>

            Regarding the question of experience and expertise, we invariably
            have collaborators in our projects – people who advise, people whose

            care for our basic needs.

            In relation to community- and socially engaged practices, it is
            important to consider the relationships we want to build through our
            projects. We must ask ourselves:
            <br />
            <i>
              Am I genuinely bringing people together, fostering discussions,
              mediating the creation of communities, redirecting institutional
              resources into marginalised communities, creating space?{' '}
            </i>
            <br />
            <i>
              Or, am I parachuting into a community – appropriating the
              knowledge and experiences of its members and converting them into
              cultural capital for myself?
            </i>
            <br />
            <i>
              Are the relationships I’m trying to build here sustainable, or
              will they crumble once the project is over?
            </i>
            <br />
            <i>
              Am I, as the instigator and organiser of a project, ensuring that
              there is an environment of trust and care for those I’m working
              with?
            </i>
            <br />
            It is all too often in socially engaged practices that we see
            communities, particularly of vulnerable or marginalised people,
            essentially being used as photoshoot props for someone’s portfolio.
            This is obviously unethical. It is also common that socially engaged
            projects are designed without much interest in the needs and
            well-being of those involved, nor is there much consideration
            regarding the result (or lack thereof) of the project. In the same
            vein we might ask:
            <br />
            <i>
              Is the change my project is trying to make lasting and sustainable
              in the long run – or am I attempting to apply a bandaid on a
              systemic issue that is much more complicated than I can handle?
            </i>
          </>,
          <>
            Again In relation to working with communities, we may ask ourselves:
            <br />
            <i>
              Is my project isolated in an art space, or is it easily accessible
              to a non-art crowd?
            </i>
            <br />
            <i>
              Can it potentially be integrated into various facets of everyday
              life?
            </i>
            <br />
            It is a frequent complaint of young artists in particular that only
            “art people” visit art exhibitions. The reality is that anything
            situated in an “art space”, that is to say some variant of the white
            cube, is naturally only going to be engaged with those with the
            necessary training to navigate the (by design) hostile and elitist
            environment. Additionally, a visit to an art gallery or museum
            requires a certain amount of time available for “calm contemplation”
            of the exhibited works: this time and this calmness is a privilege
            that not all have. While white cube type spaces in general should
            already be delegated to the trash bin of art history, it is
            particularly egregious for any community- or socially engaged art
            project to be hosted in such a space. Regarding the question on
            integration, we must be wary of going the opposite directions and
            shoving our ill-conceived projects down people’s throats – see the
            first paragraph of questions in this section.
          </>,
          <>
            In relation to the previous and with a particular focus to the
            circumstances of the pandemic, we might also ask:
            <br />
            <i>
              Am I designing a project that is accessible during this time of
              isolation?
            </i>
            <br />
            <i>
              What demands am I making of my potential public in terms of
              technological equipment?
            </i>
            <br />
            <i>Who is excluded by these demands?</i>
            <br />
            It goes without saying that not every artistic project is for
            everyone all the time – the purpose of some works is to explore and
            map the possibilities of a new technology. However, many of the
            digital exhibitions we have seen this past year have been simply
            inaccessible to those with less-updated hardware, or no hardware at
            all. From a degrowth perspective, the issue here isn’t “how to make
            advanced technology more accessible”, but rather:
            <br />
            <i>
              How can we formulate artistic projects that respect both the need
              for physical distance and the lack of interest in or the means to
              constantly invest in new hardware?
            </i>
          </>,
          <>
            From the above, we might start asking about the resources required
            for our projects:
            <br />
            <i>
              What is the carbon footprint of this project in terms of
              materials?
            </i>
            <br />
            <i>In terms of energy?</i>
            <br />
            <i>In terms of travel?</i>
            <br />
            <i>Can these costs to the environment be minimised?</i>
            <br />
            Unnecessary travel has already been greatly reduced due to the
            pandemic, but even once we are all vaccinated and free to move again
            (if such a clear-cut happily-ever-after is possible in the near
            future) there is no reason to resume this behaviour. These questions
            might be alternatively asked as:
            <br />
            <i>Am I prioritising spectacle over substance?</i>
            <br />
            <i>
              Can the message of this project be successfully conveyed using
              less?
            </i>{' '}
            or,{' '}
            <i>
              Can the purpose of this project be successfully realised using
              less?
            </i>
          </>,
          <>
            Finally, we must be prepared to ask ourselves and each other
            difficult questions; we must be prepared to question every facet of
            our to-date practices; and we must be prepared to run against the
            grain of capitalist society. In this endeavour, we are attempting to
            formulate new ways of existing in the world and in relation to each
            other; we are mapping uncharted territory. This will not be easy –
            but again, if <em>we</em> do not do this, who will?

                The term Buen Vivir meaning living well originates from the
                indigenous communities of South America with a notable presence
                in Ecuador and Bolivia. This “good life” is a pluralistic
                concept, and therefore not about a single, homogeneous standard
                of a good life, but rather about people living well together in
                a community, about different communities living well together,
                and about individuals and communities living well with nature.
                As such, Buen Vivir differs from the Western/Northern worldview
                in that it has community and not capitalist roots. It breaks
                both with the anthropocentric view of capitalism as the dominant
                civilisation and with the different manifestations of socialism
                to date. The “good life” entails a process of decolonisation,
                which should also involve depatriarchalisation. This
                necessitates a profound process of intellectual decolonisation
                on political, social, economic and cultural levels.

                control said instruments. For Illich, conviviality is the

                cooperative, mutual, sociable and sharing approach.
